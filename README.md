## Bluetooth Tracking ##
A Device made on Arduino to track devices/send notifications to devices near it through Bluetooth

### Objective ###
To track any object Realtime, means we will be fully aware of the location of object in terms of latitude and longitude, and would be able to see realtime movement of object.

### Materials and Methods ###
Raspberry Pi Board for Sending Data Received by Arduino board to Global Server, Arduino Uno Board to receive and analyse data, Motion Sensor to detect motion of object, Light Sensor to detect motion of object, Global Server to save data and then act as a server from where data can be fetched to many deveics(laptop, computer)
