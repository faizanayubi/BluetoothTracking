## Object Tracking ##
A Device made on Arduino to track objects near it through Bluetooth/IR Sensor and also communicate with Bluetooth Devices

### Objective ###
To track any object Realtime, means we will be fully aware of the location of object and would be able to see realtime movement of object.

### Materials and Methods ###
Arduino Board for Sending Data Received by IR Sensor to Global Server, Arduino Uno Board to receive and analyse data, Motion Sensor to detect motion of object, Light Sensor to detect motion of object, Global Server to save data and then act as a server from where data can be fetched to many deveics(laptop, computer)
